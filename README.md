# MusicWiki App
### The app presents an **organized collection of songs**, grouped primarily under different *Genres*. 
Under each genre, the songs are further grouped under *Albums* and *Artists*. Additionally, there 
is a third tab *Tracks* that lists all the tracks under this genre ***at once***

**You can test the application APK file is attached with this project in apk folder in root directory**


- ## Exploring the app features:

    - ### Home Screen
      - The home screen shows the top 10 genres to the user and the list expands to show all the available genres(50).
      - To make things convinient for the users, *a _search bar_ has been added* so that users can directly search for the genre of their choice.

      - The name of genre selected on the top.
      - An info button at top right corner, that shows the information of the genre, when clicked.
      - Three tabs, *Artists, Albums and Tracks*, only one of which can be selected to be on display at a time.

- ## Assumptions

    :point_right: No user would like to manually look for his choice genre in a large list of genres,
		  a **search operation is desired**.
		  
    :point_right: Excess textual information is less engaging. So details are not shown directly in launch of any activity
		  Keeping the textual **information behind a info button gives a better appearance**. 
      
    :point_right: Any data from server (artist, tracks, albums or genres) contains lakhs of data items. So App is showing top 50 item from any data list.
